# The Game of Pig

This app implements the Pig (dice) Game. Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total (50 points), but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Hugo Di Francesco (Professional JavaScript) and it is developed entirely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
